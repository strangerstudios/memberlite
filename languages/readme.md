# Translation Files for Memberlite Theme

This directory contains language files (`.pot`, `.po`, and `.mo`) used for the internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of this theme.

## Overview

While the `.pot` (Portable Object Template) file is generated from this theme's source code, translations are **not managed within the theme directly**. Instead, all translations are maintained on our collaborative translation server:

[translate.strangerstudios.com/projects/memberlite/](https://translate.strangerstudios.com/projects/memberlite/)

> Note: `.po` and `.mo` files included here are optional/local backups or references. The primary and up-to-date source of translations is on our translation server.

## Syncing Notes

- Developers may regenerate the `.pot` file as needed when new strings are added.
- Translations should **not** be directly edited or submitted to this repository.
